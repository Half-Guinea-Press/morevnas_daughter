For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.Similar Area.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8<sup>th</sup> level or lower. You don\u2019t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u2019s life drain attack.- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way.

Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it.

Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.Magic Items.

Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.

If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object\u2019s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.

The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day.

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u2019s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.Mishap. The spell\u2019s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

You don\u2019t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u2019s life drain attack.- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p> <p>Source: SRD</p>"},{"location":"spells/spell_details/#word-of-recall","title":"Word Of Recall","text":"<p>6<sup>th</sup>-level Conjuration Casting Time:1 action Range: 5 feet Duration: Instantaneous Component: V</p> <p>Spell Description: You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.

This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\u2019t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

The trench extends across the spell\u2019s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn\u2019t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p> <p>Source: SRD</p>"},{"location":"spells/spells/Control%20Weather/","title":"Control Weather","text":"<p>8<sup>th</sup>-level Transmutation Casting Time:10 minutes Range: Self 5-mile radius Concentration Duration: up to 8 hours Component: V, S, M burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water</p> <p>Spell Description: You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3<sup>rd</sup> level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature\u2019s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM\u2019s choice).When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn\u2019t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature\u2019s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature\u2019s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p> <p>Source: SRD</p>"},{"location":"spells/spells/Planar%20Binding/","title":"Planar Binding","text":"<p>5<sup>th</sup>-level Abjuration Casting Time:1 hour Range: 60 feet Duration: 24 hours Component: V, S, M* a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes</p> <p>Spell Description: With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service.
