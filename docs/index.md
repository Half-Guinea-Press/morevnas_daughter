    -   Hermit Discovery

        ---

        The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

        Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

    -   Shadow Touched

        ---

        Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
        - Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.
        - You learn the invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the illusion or necromancy school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

    -   Skill Expert

        ---

        You have honed your proficiency with particular skills, granting you the following benefits:
        - Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
        - You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
        - Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus..

    -   Spell Sniper

        ---

        You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:
        - When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.
        - Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
        - You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.

=== "Class Features"

    <div class="grid cards" markdown>

    -   Spell Casting

        ---

        Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

    -   Witch's Curse(Possessed)

        ---

        Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells do not count against your total number of spells known.

    -   Hexes

        ---

        You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic which cursed you.

        At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain witch levels, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex.

        Unless otherwise stated, if a hex calls for an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack bonus or spell save DC. All hexes require verbal or somatic components (caster’s choice at the time of casting.)

        Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, and you make only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both.

    -   Cackle

        ---

        At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to cackle. The duration of your hex extends by 1 round for each creature affected within 60 feet of you.Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards.

    -   Familiar

        ---

        At 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual without material components. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. The spell is improved in the following ways:
        • Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice).
        • Once per turn as an action or a bonus action, you 
        can mentally command your familiar to use its 
        reaction to make one attack.
        • When you cast a spell, you can deliver it through your familiar as if it had cast the spell, even if the spell doesn’t have a range of touch.
        • When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: death snail*, flying book*, homunculus, mock*, moon jelly*, pet rock*, pseudodragon, rag doll*, sprite, tin soldier*, winter wolf pup*, and yarn golem*. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C.

        As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued with your insidious magic, granting them the following benefits:
        • Your familiar can use your spell attack bonus for its attack rolls.
        • Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage rolls.
        • You add twice your witch level to your familiar’s maximum hit points.

    -   Witch's Craft(White Magic)

        ---

        Your knowledge of magic has culminated in learning a Craft, an innate variety of magic which exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level, choose one Witch’s Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
        
        If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn't count against your total number of hexes known.

    -   Bonus Spells

        ---

        Spell Level Spells
        - 1st bless, cure wounds
        - 2nd lesser restoration, prayer of healing
        - 3rd beacon of hope, revivify
        - 4th death ward, guardian of faith
        - 5th mass cure wounds, raise dead

    -   Hex(Remedy)

        ---

        At 3rd level, you learn a hex which closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature which regains hit points from this hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

    -   Talisman of Protection

        ---

        At 6th level, you can craft a talisman which wards off harm. Creating a talisman takes one hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous talisman to become mundane. Any creature that wears a talisman can add a d4 to all saving throws it makes.

    -   Benevolent Surge

        ---

        At 10th level, when you, your familiar, or one of your allies you can see within 30 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.

    -   Insidious Spell

        ---

        Starting at 5th level, when you cast a witch spell that affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex, that creature has disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a hostile creature which is the sole target of your hex.

    -   Improved Familiar

        ---

        At 7th level, your familiar’s attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity. Additionally, you can choose the following forms for your familiar: brass dragon wyrmling (without its breath weapon), fright*, grep*, imp, or quasit. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk are in Appendix C.

    -   Dying Curse

        ---

        Beginning at 9th level, when a creature reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you can lay a nefarious curse upon them. The creature is cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the creature is targeted by the remove curse spell, the curse ends at the end of the creature’s next turn.Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

=== "Hexes"

    <div class="grid cards" markdown>

    -   Beckon Familiar

        ---

        You can cast the find familiar spell as an action without expending a spell slot or spell components. Once you cast this spell in this manner, you can’t do so again for 1 minute.You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex.

    -   Doomward

        ---

        As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself you can see within 60 feet. If this creature drops to 0 hit points before the end of your next turn and doesn’t die outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. This hex then ends and can’t be used to target the same creature until you finish a short or long rest.

    -   Duplicity

        ---

        As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate self, composed of shadowstuff, to confuse your enemies. When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses, regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even roll, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.

    -   Obfuscate

        ---

        As an action, you create a 20-foot radius sphere of fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

    -   Remedy

        ---

        At 3rd level, you learn a hex which closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. This creature regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature which regains hit points from this hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

    -   Ruin

        ---

        As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s Armor Class decreases by 3, to a minimum of 10, until the end of your next turn.

        A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

        2nd-level divination
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: Self
        Components: V, S, M (a forked twig)
        Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
        Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.
        The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
        This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: 30 feet
        Components: V, S
        Duration: 1 minute
        A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
        You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
        The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

    -   Magic Circle

        ---

        3rd-level abjuration
        Casting Time: 1 minute
        Range: 10 feet
        Components: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
        Duration: 1 hour
        You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
        Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:
        - The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
        - The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.
        - Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.
        When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

        Components: V, S
        Duration: Instantaneous
        A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

    -   Message

        Transmutation cantrip
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: 120 feet
        Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
        Duration: 1 round
        You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
        You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

    -   MINOR LIFESTEAL

        ---

        Necromancy cantrip
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: 60 feet
        Components: S
        Duration: Instantaneous
        You drain life energy from a hostile creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage. You then gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt, which lasts until you finish a long rest. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)

    -   Polymorph

        ---

        4th-level transmutation
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: 60 feet
        Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
        Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
        This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
        The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
        The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
        The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
        The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: 10 feet
        Components: V, S
        Duration: Up to 1 hour
        This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
        - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
        - You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
        - You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
        - You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
        - You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
        - You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
        If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
        
    -   Produce flame

        ---

        Conjuration cantrip
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: Self
        Components: V, S
        Duration: 10 minutes
        A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
        You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.
        This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

    -   Raise dead

        ---

        5th-level necromancy
        Casting Time: 1 hour
        Range: Touch
        Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the spell consumes)
        Duration: Instantaneous
        You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
        This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature to life.
        This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
        Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

        Components: V, S
        Duration: Instantaneous
        A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.
        
        At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

        Range: Touch
        Components: V, S
        Duration: Instantaneous
        At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

    -   Revivify

        3rd-level necromancy
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: Touch
        Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)
        Duration: Instantaneous
        You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

    -   RUSTING GRASP

        ---

        3rd-level transmutation
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: Touch
        Components: V, S
        Duration: Instantaneous
        You conjure a potent acid at your fingertips, which can corrode metal and burn flesh. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within your reach. On a hit, a creature takes 6d4 acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative -3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed. If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn’t being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, you can destroy one additional cubic foot of a nonmagical object for each slot level above 3rd.
