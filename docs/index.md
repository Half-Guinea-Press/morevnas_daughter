    -   CURSE OF BLADES

        ---

        3rd-level enchantment<br>
        Casting Time: 1 action<br>
        Range: 60 feet<br>
        Components: V, S<br>
        Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

        Unholy bands of black energy tie a creature to its weapon. Choose a creature you can see that is holding a weapon within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed for the duration. A cursed target can’t willingly drop or stow its weapon. Additionally, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn, it makes one additional attack using its weapon targeting itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit. A remove curse spell ends this curse early

    -   CURSE OF CHAINS

        ---

        1st-level enchantment<br>
        Casting Time: 1 action<br>
        Range: 120 feet<br>
        Components: V, S<br>
        Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

        A black brand resembling iron shackles darkens the ankles of two creatures you can see. Choose two creatures you can see within range of the spell and within 30 feet of each other to make a Constitution saving throw. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failed save, a target is cursed for the duration. If only one target is cursed by this spell, you can use your action or bonus action on a subsequent turn to choose another target within 30 feet of the cursed creature to make a saving throw. While two creatures are cursed by this spell, they are unable to willingly move further away from each other. A remove curse spell ends this curse early.

        Duration: Instantaneous

        You fling a ball of eldritch energy at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage, and each other creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes half as much damage. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

        Transmutation cantrip Casting Time: 1 action<br>
        Range: 30 feet<br>
        Components: V, S<br>
        Duration: Instantaneous

        As you cast this spell, a spectral meat hook is flung at the creature of your choice, connected to a spectral chain. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage as a spectral meat hook plunges into their body. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target attempts to move more than 30 feet away from you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be prevented from moving farther away until the beginning of your next turn. This effect ends and the meat hook disappears at the beginning of your next turn, or if you are further than 30 feet away from the target. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8)

        Components: S<br>
        Duration: Instantaneous

        You drain life energy from a hostile creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage. You then gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt, which lasts until you finish a long rest. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)

    -   RUSTING GRASP

        ---

        3rd-level transmutation<br>
        Casting Time: 1 action<br>
        Range: Touch<br>
        Components: V, S<br>
        Duration: Instantaneous

        You conjure a potent acid at your fingertips, which can corrode metal and burn flesh. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within your reach. On a hit, a creature takes 6d4 acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative -3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed. If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn’t being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, you can destroy one additional cubic foot of a nonmagical object for each slot level above 3rd.
