You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.<br>An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions.

Regardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.<br>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20.
