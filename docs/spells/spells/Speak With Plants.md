Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.<br>Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.<br>If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.<br>This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.
