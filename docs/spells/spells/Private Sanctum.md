Spell Description:<br>
You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.<br>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:<br>- Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.<br>- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.<br>- Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.<br>- Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.<br>- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.<br>- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels:<br>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.
