When the weaponâ€™s ammunition is depleted, new ammunition teleports from your person to your hand or into the weapon, as appropriate. If the weapon takes an action or longer to reload, it reloads itself at the end of your turn.<br>If you are not carrying sufficient ammunition for the weapon to reload, the spell ends.
