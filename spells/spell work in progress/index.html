Casting Time:1 minute<br/>
Range: Touch
60-foot-radius sphere<br/>
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered<br/>
Component: V, S, M*<br/>
mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.<br/>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.<br/>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.<br/>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br/>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.<br/>Death. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.<br/>Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br/>Fear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.<br/>Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.<br/>Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.<br/>Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.<br/>Sleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.<br/>Stunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.</p>

Casting Time:1 action<br/>
Range: 60 feet<br/>
Concentration<br/>
Duration: up to 10 minutes<br/>
Component: V, S</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.<br/>Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.<br/>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.<br/>Object. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.<br/>If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.<br/>You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.</p>

Component: V</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.<br/>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.<br/>| Familiarity       | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |<br/>|-|--|--||--|<br/>| Permanent circle  | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |<br/>| Associated object | —      | —            | —          | 01–100    |<br/>| Very familiar     | 01–05  | 06–13        | 14–24      | 25–100    |<br/>| Seen casually     | 01–33  | 34–43        | 44–53      | 54–100    |<br/>| Viewed once       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |<br/>| Description       | 01–43  | 44–53        | 54–73      | 74–100    |<br/>| False destination | 01–50  | 51–100       | —          | —         |<br/>Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.<br/>“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.<br/>“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.<br/>On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.<br/>Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.<br/>Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.<br/>Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>

<p>Spell Description:<br/>
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br/>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.<br/>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.</p>

a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.<br/>This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.<br/>Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.<br/>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.<br/>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.<br/>The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.<br/>Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.<br/>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.<br/>Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.</p>

<p>Spell Description:<br/>
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot- by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.<br/>If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.<br/>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.<br/>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.<br/>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.<br/>If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>

<p>Spell Description:<br/>
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20- foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.<br/>If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.<br/>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a<br/>Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.<br/>A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.<br/>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>

The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>

<p>Spell Description:<br/>
You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.<br/>If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</p>

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.<br/>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.</p>

<p>9<sup>th</sup>-level Conjuration<br/>
Casting Time:1 action<br/>
Range: Self<br/>
Duration: Instantaneous<br/>
Component: V</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.<br/>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8<sup>th</sup> level or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.<br/>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:<br/>- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.<br/>- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.<br/>- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.<br/>- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.<br/>- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.<br/>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.<br/>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>

At the time of casting, choose any period of time up to the last 10 days to the present; only footprints and fingerprints left within that time will be highlighted.

It uses a melee weapon, if it has one, or an improvised weapon or unarmed strike, if it doesn’t. If multiple targets are within the creature’s reach, it chooses its target randomly. If there is no target within the creature’s reach, it attacks itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit.<br/>At the end of its turn, a frenzied creature can repeat its saving throw, ending the effect on it early on a success.</p>

a decorated, gothic manor miniature worth at least 1,000 gp</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
A rift opens, pouring forth tons of brick and stonework that neatly and quickly assemble into a vast gothic estate. The estate consists of a manor containing a vault, a spacious 200-by-200-foot courtyard, and a 10-foot high wrought iron fence around the perimeter. Any creature within the estate’s area is escorted away by harmless but forceful specters.<br/>You can create any floor plan you like for the manor, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, or five stories in total, including basements. The manor is adorned with barred windows and decorative gargoyles, but is furnished and decorated as you choose. Once the manor is first created, these details are recorded in<br/>the miniature manor used to cast the spell and can’t be changed. The manor is staffed by 50 skeletons obedient to you and contains enough food to serve 50 people each day for a week. The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.<br/>The manor contains a 15-foot cube vault, which is an extradimensional space. Items placed within the vault will be present next time you cast this spell.<br/>The courtyard is drenched in necromantic magic, such that any humanoid buried in its grounds rises 24 hours later as a ghoul under your control, as per the spell animate dead. When the spell is cast, 3 ghouls are animated in the courtyard. These undead are under your control, but can’t leave the estate. They patrol the estate if given no other instructions. Undead can’t be turned within the estate.<br/>The estate crumbles into dust and bone after 7 days, and all items placed within the manor appear safely in the space the manor occupied. If cast in the same place once every 7 days for a year, the estate becomes permanent.</p>

You magically compel a creature within range to a nonmagical game with vital consequences.

When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically-prepared human heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming skeletons or zombies (the GM has the creatures’ game statistics). The undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates<br/>The creature that is holding the heart can use its action to issue a general command to all undead created by the spell, such as to destroy a town or hunt down a particular creature. Only one general command can be issued to the undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.<br/>Even while you hold the heart, the undead are not directly under your control, and therefore don't count against any limitations of undead you can command.<br/>The undead remain animated until the spell ends. The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, psychic damage) or targeted by a dispel magic spell cast as a 9<sup>th</sup> level spell. When the spell ends, all undead animated by it are instantly destroyed, crumpling into a heap. The spell also ends if every undead created by it is destroyed.</p>

If left to its own devices, the target will quickly adopt a new name and begin to build a new identity. A remove curse spell cast using a 9<sup>th</sup> level spell slot ends this curse. When this curse ends, the target regains all its past memories.</p>

<p>Spell Description:<br/>
You and at least three willing creatures lock hands in a moment of meditation to conjure a spirit from the afterlife to answer your questions. Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, it manifests as a ghostly specter. This spell fails if the spirit was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.<br/>Until the spell ends, you can ask up to three questions of the specter. The specter knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the specter is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. There is a 5% chance that this spell contacts the wrong spirit, one which will answer questions untruthfully or ambiguously.</p>

Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.<br/>If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>

Casting Time:1 action<br/>
Range: Self<br/>

Duration: up to 1 minute<br/>
Component: V, S, M<br/>
an octopus tentacle</p>
<p>Spell Description:<br/>
When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can command one of these tentacles to grapple a Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the tentacle. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, freeing itself on a success.<br/>You can grapple as many creatures as you have tentacles. You can use an action or bonus action on your turn to release a grappled creature, or to drag it up to 20 feet in a direction you choose. You can also use the tentacles to manipulate objects as an action or a bonus action. Each tentacle can lift up to 100 pounds, and you can command multiple tentacles to work together to lift the same object as part of the same action or bonus action. The tentacles are not capable of detailed control—for example, they cannot open a chest or uncork a bottle. Burning objects are extinguished when a tentacle grabs them.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels:<br/>
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5<sup>th</sup> level or higher, you gain an additional tentacle for every slot level above 4<sup>th</sup>.</p>
